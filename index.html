          <h3>Other Hobbies & Interests</h3>
          I have always been a passionate individual, and this expresses itself through hyper-fixation on hobbies.
		  <br>In my youth, these interests were Pokémon and baseball.
		  <br>In my teenage years, they evolved to skateboarding and video games.
		  <br>In college, they became math, bodybuilding, and speedcubing.
		  <br>In my post-college years, it was programming, stock trading, and music making.
		  <br>And now in my 30s, they have been bowling, golf, reading & writing, fish keeping, and woodworking.

          <h3>About Me</h3>
          I was born and raised in a suburb of Los Angeles named La Verne, CA.
		  <br>I spent my privileged and carefree youth on Elmcrest, surrounded by my best friends.
		  <br>I attended college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and left in 2014 with a B.S. in Mathematics.
		  <br>I then moved to Madison, WI in search of seasonality, and met not only a second set of best friends, but my future wife.
		  <br>My wife and I then moved to Boise, ID for a couple years in the spirit of novelty.
		  <br>Today, I live in Madison with my wife, Miki, our dog, Riley, and our two cats, Sushi & Hazel.

		text: "It is a good thing to learn the truth one’s self. To first believe with all your heart, and then not to believe, is good, too. It fattens the emotions and makes them stretch… In teaching your child, do not forget that suffering is good too. It makes a person rich in character.",
