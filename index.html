	<h1>Hello World</h1>
	<p>
		You are what you consume. The books you read, the music you listen to, the movies you watch.
		<br>The places you've lived, the people you've met, the conversations you've had.
		<br>I have an obsession with identity: uniqueness, expression, formation.
		<br>This page attempts to paint the picture of who I am through the mediums that speak to me.
